    "\n",
    "为 Ray 文档做出贡献的方法有很多，我们一直在寻找新的贡献者。\n",
    "即使您只是想修正拼写错误或扩展某个部分，也请随意这样做！\n",
    "\n",
    "本文档将引导您完成开始前需要做的所有事情。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 编辑风格\n",
    "\n",
    "我们遵循 [Google 开发者文档风格指南](https://developers.google.com/style)。\n",
    "以下是一些重点内容：\n",
    "\n",
    "* [使用现在时](https://developers.google.com/style/tense)\n",
    "* [使用第二人称](https://developers.google.com/style/person)\n",

    "## 构建 Ray 文档\n",
    "\n",
    "如果您想为 Ray 文档做出贡献，您需要一种构建它的方法。\n",
    "您不必构建 Ray 本身，这有点复杂。\n",
    "\n",
    "您只需 [克隆 Ray 存储库](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/ray-contribute/development.html#clone-the-repository)，然后 [准备 Python 环境](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/ray-contribute/development.html#prepare-the-python-environment)。\n",
    "\n",
    "接下来，进入 `ray/doc` 路径\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "cd ray/doc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 为 Apple Silicon (M1) 构建文档\n",
    "\n",
    "注意：如果您没有使用 Apple Silicon (M1)，请跳至 [下一部分](#install-dependencies)。\n",
    "\n",
    "如果您使用的是 Apple Silicon（M1），则构建文档所需的一些依赖项默认没有可用的二进制包（PyPI 中不可用）。\n",
    "\n",
    "安装这些依赖项的最简单方法是首先使用 `conda` (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) ，`pip` 就不会尝试从头开始构建它们来安装它们。\n",
    "\n",
    "为此，请确保创建和/或激活 conda 环境，然后使用以下命令安装依赖项：\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge xgboost lightgbm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 安装依赖\n",
    "\n",
    "激活您正在使用的 Python 环境（例如 venv、conda 等）。使用以下命令安装文档依赖项：\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install -r requirements-doc.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "安装我们的 linters 的依赖项以确保您的更改符合我们的样式指南。\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install -r ../python/requirements/lint-requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "通过运行以下命令来构建文档：\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "make develop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "在 `_build` 目录中找到文档构建。\n",
    "构建完成后，您只需在浏览器打开 `_build/html/index.html` 文件。\n",
    "检查构建的输出以确保一切按预期运行是一种很好的做法。\n",
    "\n",
    "在提交任何更改之前，请确保从 `doc` 文件夹使用 `../scripts/format.sh` 运行\n",
    "[linter](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-contribute/getting-involved.html#lint-and-formatting)\n",
    "，以确保更改的格式正确。\n",
    "\n",
    "如果您的本地构建似乎没有呈现您最新的本地更改，请尝试 `make clean && sphinx-build -b html -d _build/doctrees source _build/html`。\n",
    "\n",
    "为了在本地重现 CI 构建失败，您可能需要使用 `make html`，它与 `make develop` 相同，但将警告视为错误。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 我们构建系统的基础\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray 文档是使用 [`sphinx`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) 构建系统构建。\n",
    "我们使用 [executable books project](https://github.com/executablebooks) 的 [Sphinx Book Theme](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-book-theme) 。\n",
    "\n",
    "这意味着您可以使用 Sphinx 的原生\n",
    "[reStructuredText (rST)](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html) 或者\n",
    "[Markedly Structured Text (MyST)](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 编写 Ray 文档。\n",
    "这两种格式可以互相转换，因此选择权在您手中。\n",
    "话虽如此，重要的是要知道 MyST 符合\n",
    "[常规 markdown 标准](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/reference.html#commonmark-block-tokens)。\n",
    "如果您打算添加新文档，我们建议从 `.md` 文件开始。\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray 文档还完全支持 [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) 等可执行格式。\n",
    "我们的许多示例都是带有 [MyST markdown 单元格](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) 的笔记本。\n",
    "事实上，您正在阅读的这份文档 _就是_ 一个笔记本。\n",
    "您可以通过下载 `.ipynb` 文件\n",
    "或直接在顶部导航栏中将此笔记本启动到 Binder 或 Google Colab 中来亲自检查这一点。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 贡献什么？\n",
    "\n",
    "如果以 Ray Tune 为例，您会发现我们的文档由几种类型的文档组成，您可以对所有这些文档做出贡献：\n",
    "\n",
    "- [项目登陆页面](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html),\n",
    "- [入门指南](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/getting-started.html),\n",
    "- [关键概念页面](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/key-concepts.html),\n",
    "- [主要功能的用户指南](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/tutorials/overview.html),\n",
    "- [实例](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/examples/index.html),\n",
    "- [详细的常见问题解答](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/faq.html),\n",
    "- [和 API 参考](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/api/api.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "这种结构也反映在\n",
    "[Ray 文档远吗](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/doc/source/tune) 中，因此您应该可以轻松找到所需内容。\n",
    "所有其他 Ray 项目都具有类似的结构，但根据项目的不同，可能会有细微的差异。\n",
    "\n",
    "面列出的每种类型的文档都有其自己的用途，但最终我们的文档可归结为 _两种类型_ 的文档：\n",
    "\n",
    "- Markup documents, written in MyST or rST. If you don't have a lot of (executable) code to contribute or\n",
    "  use more complex features such as\n",
    "  [tabbed content blocks](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/walkthrough.html#starting-ray), this is the right\n",
    "  choice. Most of the documents in Ray Tune are written in this way, for instance the\n",
    "  [key concepts](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/doc/source/tune/key-concepts.rst) or\n",
    "  [API documentation](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/doc/source/tune/api/api.rst).\n",
    "- Notebooks, written in `.ipynb` format. All Tune examples are written as notebooks. These notebooks render in\n",
    "  the browser like `.md` or `.rst` files, but have the added benefit of adding launch buttons to the top of the\n",
    "  document, so that users can run the code themselves in either Binder or Google Colab. A good first example to look\n",
    "  at is [this Tune example](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/doc/source/tune/examples/tune-serve-integration-mnist.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fixing typos and improving explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "If you spot a typo in any document, or think that an explanation is not clear enough, please consider\n",
    "opening a pull request.\n",
    "In this scenario, just run the linter as described above and submit your pull request.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding API references\n",
    "\n",
    "We use [Sphinx's autodoc extension](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html) to generate\n",
    "our API documentation from our source code.\n",
    "In case we're missing a reference to a function or class, please consider adding it to the respective document in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here's how you can add a function or class reference using `autofunction` and `autoclass`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    ".. autofunction:: ray.tune.integration.docker.DockerSyncer\n",
    "\n",
    ".. autoclass:: ray.tune.integration.keras.TuneReportCallback\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above snippet was taken from the\n",
    "[Tune API documentation](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/doc/source/tune/api/integration.rst),\n",
    "which you can look at for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to change the content of the API documentation, you will have to edit the respective function or class\n",
    "signatures directly in the source code.\n",
    "For example, in the above `autofunction` call, to change the API reference for `ray.tune.integration.docker.DockerSyncer`,\n",
    "you would have to [change the following source file](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/7f1bacc7dc9caf6d0ec042e39499bbf1d9a7d065/python/ray/tune/integration/docker.py#L15-L38).\n",
    "\n",
    "To show the usage of APIs, it is important to have small usage examples embedded in the API documentation. These should be self-contained and run out of the box, so a user can copy and paste them into a Python interpreter and play around with them (e.g., if applicable, they should point to example data). Users often rely on these examples to build their applications. To learn more about writing examples, read [How to write code snippets](writing-code-snippets).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding code to an `.rST` or `.md` file\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying text in an existing documentation file is easy, but you need to be careful when it comes to adding code.\n",
    "The reason is that we want to ensure every code snippet on our documentation is tested.\n",
    "This requires us to have a process for including and testing code snippets in documents. To learn how to write testable code \n",
    "snippets, read [How to write code snippets](writing-code-snippets).\n"
